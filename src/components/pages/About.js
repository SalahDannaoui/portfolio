      Hi, I am Salah and this is my developer page. I am a full stack developer. I have been focusing my learning mainly on Javascript and the MERN stack.
      I am currently enrolled in the University of Sydney's Coding Bootcamp in collaboration with edX.
      I am looking forward to learning more about web development and creating some awesome projects.
